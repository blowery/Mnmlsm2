# Mnmlsm 2

A very minimal message style for [Adium](http://adium.im).
Nothing else than just what you need in a list of messages.
Includes simplified controls for file transfers


## Installation

You will be able to get this theme in it's most stable version from AdiumXtras.com, but if you want to live on the cutting edge you can easily clone the repository from Github to Adium settings folder like so:

    git clone git://github.com/pichfl/Mnmlsm2.git ~/Library/Application\ Support/Adium\ 2.0/Message\ Styles/Mnmlsm2.AdiumMessageStyle

If you want to update the repository, just cd into it and use git pull.

## Credits

The colors for the Twitterrific substyles are from the awesome Twitter client of the same name made by the famous [Iconfactory](http://iconfactory.com/).

The colors for the Tomorrow substyles are obviously taken from [the color theme](https://github.com/ChrisKempson/Tomorrow-Theme) by Chris Kempson
